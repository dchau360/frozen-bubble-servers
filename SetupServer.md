# Setting Up a Frozen Bubble Multiplayer Server

This guide walks through running a public server that supports both:

- **Native clients** (desktop, Android) — raw TCP on port **1511**
- **Browser clients** (itch.io / WASM) — secure WebSocket (`wss://`) on port **443**

> **Browser clients require a valid SSL certificate on a real domain name.**
> A plain IP address or self-signed certificate will be rejected by browsers.
> Native clients are unaffected — they connect on port 1511 without SSL.

The free path covered here uses **Oracle Cloud** (free VPS) + **No-IP** (free domain) +
**Let's Encrypt** (free SSL certificate).

---

## Step 1 — Create a Server (Oracle Cloud Free Tier)

Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier includes 2 AMD VMs (1 OCPU, 1 GB RAM) — more than
enough for fb-server.

1. Sign up at [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com)
2. Create an instance: **Compute → Instances → Create Instance**
   - Image: **Ubuntu 22.04**
   - Shape: **VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro** (Always Free)
3. Note the instance's **Public IP address** — you'll need it in Step 2

**Open ports in the VCN security list:**

Go to **Networking → Virtual Cloud Networks → your VCN → Security Lists → Default**
and add ingress rules for TCP ports **80**, **443**, and **1511**.

**Also open ports in the OS firewall** (Oracle images block ports at the OS level
even after the security list is updated — this catches a lot of people):

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1511 -j ACCEPT
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

> Using a different VPS provider? Just ensure ports 80, 443, and 1511 are open in
> your provider's firewall / security group and skip the iptables step unless your
> OS firewall also blocks them.

---

## Step 2 — Get a Free Domain (No-IP)

Now that you have your server's public IP, point a domain at it.
[No-IP](https://www.noip.com) offers free dynamic DNS hostnames (e.g. `myfbserver.ddns.net`)
that work with Let's Encrypt.

1. Create a free account at [noip.com](https://www.noip.com)
2. Go to **Dynamic DNS → No-IP Hostnames → Create Hostname**
3. Choose a hostname and enter your server's public IP from Step 1
4. Install the No-IP Dynamic Update Client on your server so the hostname stays
   current if your IP ever changes:

```bash
sudo apt install noip2
sudo noip2 -C          # enter your No-IP credentials when prompted
sudo systemctl enable noip2 --now
```

> Free No-IP hostnames require confirmation every 30 days to stay active —
> you'll receive an email reminder.

Use your No-IP hostname (e.g. `myfbserver.ddns.net`) anywhere this guide
refers to `yourdomain.com`.

> Already have a paid domain? Skip this step and point your DNS A record at
> the server's public IP instead.

---

## Step 3 — Install Docker

```bash
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc >/dev/null
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo ${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list >/dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable docker --now
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   # lets you run docker without sudo (re-login after)
```

---

## Step 4 — Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dchau360/frozen-bubble-sdl3.git
cd frozen-bubble-sdl3
```

---

## Step 5 — Get a Free SSL Certificate (Let's Encrypt)

Run certbot **before** starting Docker so port 80 is free:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
```

On first run certbot will:
1. Ask for an **email address** — used for expiry reminders and account recovery
2. Ask you to agree to the **Let's Encrypt Terms of Service**
3. Verify domain ownership over port 80
4. Write the certificate to `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`

---

## Step 6 — Link the Certificates into Place

```bash
sudo tools/link-fb-certs.sh yourdomain.com
```

`tools/link-fb-certs.sh` (checked into the repo) symlinks `docker/ssl/*.pem`
to `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/*.pem` rather than copying them:
that `live/` path is itself a symlink into `archive/`, and `certbot renew`
repoints it to the freshly renewed file without ever changing the `live/`
path itself. Symlinking `docker/ssl/*.pem` to it means renewal never needs a
copy step again — the script also recreates the nginx container so the
newly-linked cert actually gets served (Docker resolves a bind-mounted
symlink once, at container creation, so a running nginx keeps serving
whatever cert was live when *it* started even after the symlink is
repointed). It's idempotent, so running it again later (e.g. after a
renewal) is always safe — see the script's own header for details. Domain is
a required argument; there's no default, since this script is shared across
every hoster's own server.

---

## Step 7 — Start the Server

```bash
cd docker
./setup.sh -d          # -d runs in background
```

This builds fb-server from source and starts the game server, the nginx TLS
proxy, and the Discord join-alert relay. To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## The Website on Port 443

Port 443 does two jobs. A WebSocket handshake (`Upgrade: websocket`, which
every browser game client sends) is proxied to `fb-server`; anything else is
an ordinary browser, and gets served a website instead. Before this existed
nginx answered those requests with an HTTP 426, so visiting your domain in a
browser produced an error page rather than anything useful.

The pages are generated from the repo's own markdown (`site/index.md` and
`docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`) by `tools/build-site.py`, and baked into the nginx
image by `docker/Dockerfile.site` at build time — the same generator and the
same sources that produce the project's GitHub Pages site, so the two cannot
drift apart.

**Two consequences worth knowing if you host your own server:**

1. Page content only changes when the image is **rebuilt**. `docker compose
   up -d nginx` restarts the container but keeps the old pages; use
   `docker compose up -d --build nginx`. (`nginx.conf` and the certificates
   are bind-mounted, not baked in, so *those* still only need a restart.)
2. The site you serve is **this project's** landing page — it describes the
   game, links to its store listings, and names the Android build's
   publisher. That's deliberate (it's the game's own GPL'd site, and it
   links back to the upstream repo), but it is not *your* page. If you'd
   rather your domain not serve it, either point the `nginx` service back at
   `image: nginx:alpine` and restore the old 426 response in
   `docker/nginx.conf`, or mount your own directory over
   `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

---

## Optional — Discord Join & Result Alerts

Every time a player arrives on your server, it can post a message to a
Discord channel of your choosing — their nick, your server's name, and, if
their client reported them, a platform badge (which OS they're on) and a
country flag. The alert fires when they connect and appear in the lobby,
not when they join a game room: someone waiting alone in a room they just
opened is the person an alert should bring company to, and once a second
player has joined them the notification has nothing left to offer. Neither
the player's IP nor their precise self-reported coordinates are included,
deliberately: a Discord channel can have members well beyond whoever runs
the server, and the game itself now invites players into a community
Discord from its own UI, so an alert channel is a good deal more public
than it used to be. The country flag is the one location-adjacent signal
that *is* included — it's roughly the granularity a public server list
already shows, not the finer position behind the lobby's world map — see
[server/discord-relay/README.md](server/discord-relay/README.md) if you'd
rather drop it.

The same relay also posts a message at the end of every round: the game
mode, who won (or that it was a draw), and the full player roster — each
name alongside their platform, input-device, and country badges where
reported. It uses
the same webhook, the same `DISCORD_SERVER_NAME` override, and the same
stub/live modes below — there is nothing extra to configure. See
[Round-result alerts](#round-result-alerts) further down for the details
and what it does and doesn't include.

This works out of the box in a **stub mode** that logs what it would have
posted but delivers nothing. Making alerts actually arrive needs a Discord
webhook URL, which only you as the operator can obtain.

> **Name your server first.** The alert says *"alice joined **&lt;your server&gt;**"*,
> and that name comes from `fb-server`'s `-n` flag. Without it the name falls
> back to the hostname, which inside a container is the container ID — your
> alerts read `alice joined ce98fdda68c6`, and the ID changes every rebuild.
> Set it in `docker/.env`:
>
> ```bash
> FB_SERVER_NAME=myserver
> ```
>
> **`-n` caps out at 12 characters, `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]` only, and `fb-server`
> refuses to start at all if it's violated** — not a warning, a hard exit,
> which under `restart: unless-stopped` means a crash loop. A domain like
> `fb.example.org` (14 chars) is already too long; something short and
> recognizable is safer than the domain itself. Confirm it took with
> `docker compose logs fb-server | grep Servername`.
>
> The same name is what your server advertises to the public server list, so
> this is worth setting whether or not you use Discord alerts at all.
>
> **Want the real name in Discord anyway?** `-n`'s limit only constrains
> what's advertised in-game — the Discord side of the pipe has no such cap.
> Set `DISCORD_SERVER_NAME` in `docker/.env` and every alert shows that
> instead, with `-n` untouched:
>
> ```bash
> DISCORD_SERVER_NAME=fb.example.org
> ```
>
> See [server/discord-relay/README.md](server/discord-relay/README.md#live-delivery).

**Nothing breaks if you skip this.** Joins still happen normally; the alert
just never fires. The relay is also entirely optional — remove
`FB_SERVER_DISCORD_RELAY` from the `fb-server` service to turn the feature
off.

### Checking the stub

```bash
docker compose logs discord-relay
```

A join logs a line like:

```
[stub] would post: 🔔 **alice** joined **myserver**
```

A round ending logs one too:

```
[stub] would post: 🏆 **alice** won (Race) on **myserver** — alice, bob
```

### Going live

In Discord: Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook, pick the
channel it should post to, and copy its URL. Set it in a `.env` file next to
`docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

Then `docker compose up -d --build discord-relay`. That one URL is both the
credential and the channel selector — create a different webhook to alert a
different channel.

The webhook does not have to be one you made. If a community channel has
issued you a URL so your server's joins show up alongside everyone else's,
set that as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` here and nothing else changes. Running
your own channel and posting to someone else's are the same one-variable
setup — see
[server/discord-relay/README.md](server/discord-relay/README.md) if you are
on the issuing end.

> **Don't want to stand up your own Discord for this?** If you're running a
> public Frozen Bubble server and would rather your join and round-result
> alerts (including the bubbles-popped stats below) show up in the
> project's own community Discord instead, open a
> [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dchau360/frozen-bubble-sdl3/issues) or
> ask in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/uE4dq8fqGW) itself and we'll issue
> your server its own webhook into the shared round-stats channel — set it
> as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` above and nothing else about your setup changes.
> Each server gets its own webhook, not a shared credential, so one server's
> access can be revoked later without touching anyone else's — see
> [Collecting joins from servers you don't run](server/discord-relay/README.md#collecting-joins-from-servers-you-dont-run)
> for exactly what that does and doesn't grant.

A burst of joins can hit Discord's per-webhook rate limit; a request that
gets rate-limited is logged and dropped rather than queued or retried.

The message carries neither an IP address nor a location, but it does carry
a nick, and a running stream of them says who plays on your server and when
— keep the webhook URL somewhere sensible all the same. Anyone who has it
can post anything to that channel, not just what this relay sends.

> **The in-game "Join our Discord" row is not this.** The NET GAME list and
> the online lobby each offer players a link to the game's *community*
> Discord, which is a fixed URL compiled into the client — it has nothing to
> do with your webhook and does not point at your channel. If you want your
> own players in your own Discord, advertise it yourself; there is no way
> for a server to change where that in-game link goes, deliberately (see
> `kDiscordInviteUrl` in `src/platform.cpp`).

### Round-result alerts

Posted once per round — when someone claims the win (or the round ends in a
draw), not once per full match. There's no reliable way to tell server-side
when a "match" (best-of-N by whatever win count a room's players agreed on)
is truly over, since that count only ever lives client-side and can differ
room to room, so this posts at the same granularity already shown to
players in the post-round stats table: one alert per round, saying who won,
which game mode it was played in (Classic/Clear/Race/Timed — unlabelled if
a room never set one), and every player who was in the room, each with
whatever platform, input-device, and country badges their own client
reported (empty for one that reported none, e.g. a pre-1.4 client), plus a
win-count chart and a bubbles-popped chart underneath.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/discord-round-stats.jpg" alt="Discord round-result message: winner, roster with platform/input badges, a win-count chart, and a bubbles-popped chart" width="480">
</p>

**The winner name is not verified.** It's exactly what the reporting
client's own message said, the same way the round-over notice every other
player's screen shows is. A modified client could in principle claim a win
it didn't earn; the roster next to it, by contrast, is always accurate,
since that comes from the server's own player list, not anything a client
sent. This alert does not, and cannot, replace the winner claim any client
already displays — it's the same information, on Discord.

**A rage-quit or dropped connection is never posted as a loss.** The server
already infers a win/loss from a player leaving mid-round for its own
internal stats, but that inference is unreliable — there's no way to tell a
rage-quit from a connection drop — and misattributing an outcome to a named
player in public would be worse than just not posting one.

**This is independent of the in-game lobby announcement.** Every server, not
just one with a relay configured, also posts the same round's result as
ordinary lobby chat — visible to anyone sitting in the lobby, not players off
in another room — with the round's win-count and top-5 scorers, and (on a
team win) the team and everyone on it. Nothing to configure: it fires from
the same round-end regardless of whether `FB_SERVER_DISCORD_RELAY` is even
set. See `CLAUDE.md`'s "Round-result lobby broadcast" for the details.

> **One thread per room, not one message per round.** By default a busy
> server's round-results are flat top-level messages, same as a join alert —
> fine at first, but a long-lived room can clutter the channel with one
> message per round. Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` and
> every room's first result opens a Discord thread named after that room;
> every later round for the same room posts into it instead. Join alerts are

> 2. **OAuth2** tab → URL Generator → scope `bot` → permissions **View
>    Channel**, **Send Messages**, **Create Public Threads**, **Send
>    Messages in Threads** → open the generated URL and add the bot to your
>    server.

> ```bash
> DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
> DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

>

> every room got before this existed.

## Optional — Limit Concurrent Bots

Clients can add bots — either in a local game or, on the server, in a network
room — and a bot that joins your server identifies itself with a `BOT`
command right after connecting. Unlike a person, a bot costs you CPU on every
shot it takes (level generation, malus, chain reactions all run per board),
so if that is a resource concern, cap how many can be registered at once,
server-wide:

```yaml
    command: ["-d", "-q", "-l", "-z", "-o", "CONNECT", "-b", "20"]
```

Add that under the `fb-server` service in `docker-compose.yml` — it overrides
the image's default command (`docker/Dockerfile`'s `CMD`), so include every
flag you want, not just `-b`. `-b 0` refuses every bot outright; the default
without this override is 20. Once the cap is reached, a further bot's `BOT`
command gets `BOT_LIMIT_REACHED` and the client shows the player a message —
the connection itself is unaffected, so a capped-out bot is simply not a bot:
it can still join and play as an ordinary person would. `docker compose up -d
--build fb-server` to apply.

This is a global cap across every room on the server, not a per-room one —
clients already limit a single room to 4 bots on their own, but nothing stops
a modified client from opening more connections and registering each as a
bot, which is exactly the case this flag is for.

---

## Online Tournaments

The bundled `fb-server` also coordinates online tournaments. There is nothing to enable and no extra port or flag — it's built into the same binary and the same ports (1511 / 443) already covered above. Players create and join brackets entirely from the client's own online lobby.

### Resolving a disputed match

Each tournament match is best of three, and both players report the result themselves. If they report different winners, the match goes **disputed** and stays that way — the server never guesses, and there is no way for either player to retry on their own. Settling it takes a `RESOLVE` command sent over a connection the server has already marked **admin-authorized**.

Admin authorization here isn't a login or a password: `server/net.c` grants it automatically, once, at accept time, to any connection whose source address is exactly `127.0.0.1` (the only other command gated on it today is `ADMIN_REREAD`, an internal config-reload command — a room host's own `/kick` is a separate, unrelated permission and does not require this).

Because of Docker's networking, connecting to your published port from the host machine's own `localhost` does **not** qualify — Docker's NAT rewrites the source address before it reaches the container, so it never arrives as literally `127.0.0.1` from `fb-server`'s point of view. The connection has to originate *inside* the `fb-server` container itself:

```bash
docker compose exec fb-server bash
```

The runtime image has no `nc` or `python3` installed, but bash's own `/dev/tcp` pseudo-device is enough to speak the server's raw line protocol directly:

```bash
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/1511
head -1 <&3                                            # wait for SERVER_READY
printf 'FB/1.3 TOUR RESOLVE <tid> <mid> <winnerPid>\n' >&3
head -1 <&3                                            # read the reply
exec 3<&- 3>&-
```

(Any TCP client works the same way — the only requirement is that it run inside the container. Adjust the exact commands for whatever shell/tools you have available.)

`<tid>` and `<mid>` identify the tournament and the disputed match. A player will see both on their own bracket screen — `TOURNAMENT #<tid>` in the header, `#<mid>` on the disputed match's card, and "Awaiting operator" in their own match status — so ask whoever reported the dispute to pass them along, or connect the same way and send `TOUR STATE <tid>` to read the bracket yourself. `<winnerPid>` is either `0` — replay the disputed round without awarding anyone a win — or the numeric entrant ID of whichever of the two assigned players actually won, which commits that round's win to them. A malformed command, a winner ID that isn't one of the two assigned players, or the same command sent from a connection that isn't admin-authorized is simply denied; it also has no effect on a match that isn't currently disputed.

---

## How Players Connect

| Client | Host | Port |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop / Android (native) | `yourdomain.com` | `1511` |
| Browser (itch.io / WASM) | `yourdomain.com` | `443` |

In the game: **Net Game** → enter the host and port above → **Connect**.

---

## Abuse Reports

Players can report each other with `/report <nick> <reason>` in chat. Reports
are appended to a file for you to read; **nothing is acted on automatically**,
by design — nicks are chosen fresh on every connect and are not tied to any
account, so auto-kicking on report would hand every player a way to remove
anyone they liked.

```bash
docker compose exec fb-server cat /var/lib/fb-server/reports.log
```

Each line records the time, the reporter's nick and IP, who they reported, and
the reason. Cross-reference the IP against `joiners.log` in the same directory
if you need to identify someone across nick changes.

Override the location with `FB_SERVER_REPORT_FILE` if you want it elsewhere.
Acting on a report is entirely up to you as the operator — the game has no
built-in ban mechanism, so blocking at the firewall (or simply not running an
open server) is what enforcement looks like today.

Players also have `/block <nick>`, which hides someone's chat immediately and
entirely client-side — it needs nothing from you and works even if you never
read the report log.

---

## Updating the Server

A one-off update — pull the latest code, rebuild, and restart — is just:

```bash
cd ~/frozen-bubble-sdl3 && git pull && cd docker && docker compose up --build -d
```

But that alone doesn't touch your SSL certificate, which still needs
renewing every ~60 days (see below) and re-linking after every renewal so
nginx actually serves the new one. `tools/update-server.sh` (checked into
the repo) does both jobs — code update *and* cert renewal/relink — in one
script, safe to run by hand or on a schedule. It's a **template**: copy it
outside your checkout before using it (the script explains why in its own
header — in short, a script shouldn't `git pull` the repo it's currently
running out of):

```bash
cp ~/frozen-bubble-sdl3/tools/update-server.sh ~/update-server.sh
chmod +x ~/update-server.sh
sudo ~/update-server.sh yourdomain.com
```

That single run pulls `main`, rebuilds and restarts `fb-server`,
`discord-relay` and `nginx`, runs `certbot renew` (a no-op unless the cert
is within 30 days of expiry), and calls `tools/link-fb-certs.sh` to relink
and serve whatever cert is currently live. `nginx` is in the rebuild list
because the website it serves is generated into its image (see the section
above) — a restart alone would keep serving the previous build's pages. Read the script's own header comment for
the full flag list (`--no-pull`, `--no-renew`, `--if-due`) and for how to
schedule it (e.g. daily via cron with `--if-due`, so it renews the cert
automatically without ever double-renewing or drifting off a fixed
interval) — it's all documented there rather than duplicated here.

---

## Renewing the Certificate

Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days; renew any time within the
last 30 days of that window. If you're using `tools/update-server.sh` (see
above) on a schedule, this already happens automatically and you can skip
this section. To do it manually:

```bash
sudo certbot renew
sudo tools/link-fb-certs.sh yourdomain.com   # relinks + recreates nginx to serve it
```

`certbot renew` alone is not enough — see Step 6 above for why nginx keeps
serving the old cert until the container is recreated, which is what
`link-fb-certs.sh` handles.

Verify the renewal actually took effect before trusting it:

```bash
openssl x509 -in docker/ssl/fullchain.pem -noout -enddate
```

---

## Adding Your Server to the Public List

The game fetches a community server list from
[github.com/dchau360/frozen-bubble-servers](https://github.com/dchau360/frozen-bubble-servers)
at startup. Submit a pull request to add your server so players can find it automatically.

List both ports so native and browser players can discover your server:

```
# host:port  Display name
yourdomain.com:1511  Your Server Name (desktop/Android)
yourdomain.com:443   Your Server Name (browser)
```

To submit:

1. Fork [dchau360/frozen-bubble-servers](https://github.com/dchau360/frozen-bubble-servers)
2. Add your entries to `serverlist-1`
3. Open a pull request with your server's hostname and a brief description

---

## Local Testing (No Domain)

The `setup.sh` script generates a self-signed certificate automatically if no
valid certificate is found in `docker/ssl/`. This lets you verify the server is
running, but browser clients will reject the self-signed cert.

To test with native clients only (no Docker needed):

```bash
./build/server/fb-server -q -l -z    # port 1511
```
